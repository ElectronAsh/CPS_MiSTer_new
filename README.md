# CPS_MiSTer

Capcom Play System (CPS) core for MiSTer.


# Status
- NO video output yet! But the Verilog for tile display is in progress.
- Sprites will need to use quite a lot of BRAM (384KB or more), which will just about fit on the FPGA on the DE10 Nano.
- FX68K CPU is running code from SDRAM now (SF2 being used as the main test ROM).
- T80 (Z80) CPU is running from BRAM atm, but sound is working OK.
- ADPCM ROM will need to be moved into SDRAM later, to free up more on-chip mem.
- Player controls (via MiSTer USB / HPS) appear to be working.
